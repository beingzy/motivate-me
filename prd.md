# Motivate Me — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 0.1
**Last updated:** 2026-03-05
**Status:** Active

---

## Overview

Motivate Me is a self-development PWA that gamifies habit formation through a point system. Users earn points by logging habit-related actions, then spend points to redeem rewards — real-world items (photo-logged) or online purchases (URL-linked). An optional peer-monitor layer lets invited users observe progress and approve high-stakes redemptions. The app ships as a PWA (installable on iOS and Android home screens) and will eventually migrate to a native mobile app.

---

## Goals

1. Help individuals build lasting habits by tying action to tangible, personal rewards.
2. Make self-discipline feel like a game: streaks, bonuses, and a growing reward balance.
3. Enable lightweight social accountability via optional invited monitors — without making it a social network.

---

## Target Users

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Primary User** | An individual who wants to gamify their own self-improvement habits. |
| **Monitor** | An invited peer (friend, partner, parent, colleague) who observes the user's progress and optionally approves redemptions or helps set up the system. |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) |
| Backend / DB | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth — magic link (email only) |
| File storage | Supabase Storage (reward photos) |
| Deployment | Vercel |
| PWA | next-pwa or built-in Next.js service worker |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |

---

## UX Direction

**Gamified & playful.** Bright colors, satisfying micro-interactions, badge moments, level-up animations. Every point earned and reward unlocked should feel rewarding. Think Duolingo-level delight, not a spreadsheet.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication

- Magic link login via email — no password.
- Session persists across app restarts (PWA-friendly).
- User profile: display name, avatar (optional).

### 2. Habit Management

Users define their own habits from scratch.

**Habit fields:**
- Name (required)
- Description (optional)
- Point value per completion (user-defined integer)
- Requires photo proof on log? (toggle)
- Requires monitor approval on log? (toggle — only available if a monitor is connected)
- Frequency target: none / daily / N times per week
- Active / archived status

**Habit actions:**
- Create, edit, archive habits
- Habit list view (active habits dashboard)

### 3. Action Logging

Users log habit completions. Each log entry records:
- Which habit was completed
- Timestamp
- Optional photo upload (required if habit is set to "requires photo proof")
- Optional note
- Status: `pending_approval` | `approved` | `self_approved`

**Approval flow:**
- If habit requires monitor approval → status starts as `pending_approval`; points held until monitor approves.
- If self-reported → status is `self_approved`; points awarded immediately.

### 4. Point System

- Each approved log entry credits points to the user's balance.
- Point balance is the source of truth for all redemptions.
- Points are never negative.

**Streak mechanics:**
- Per-habit streak: consecutive days the habit was completed.
- Streak milestone bonuses (e.g., 7-day streak = +10 bonus points, 30-day = +50 bonus points). Exact values configurable.
- Breaking a streak resets it to 0.

**Frequency targets:**
- User sets a target (e.g., "3x per week").
- Dashboard shows progress toward weekly target.
- Completing a weekly target awards a bonus point block.

### 5. Rewards

Two reward types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Offline reward** | Physical item or experience. Logged with photo + title + description + date + point cost. |
| **Online reward** | URL link to a product or experience. Logged with URL + title + description + point cost. |

**Reward fields (creation):**
- Title (required)
- Type: offline / online
- Point cost (required)
- Photo (offline only, optional at creation — required at redemption)
- URL (online only)
- Description
- Requires monitor approval to redeem? (toggle; configurable per reward; default: off)
- Approval required from: select from connected monitors

**Reward states:** `available` | `in_wishlist` | `redeemed`

**Redemption flow:**
1. User initiates redemption (must have sufficient points).
2. If no approval required → immediate redemption, points deducted, user uploads photo (offline) or confirms URL (online).
3. If approval required → request sent to specified monitor(s); points held (not deducted yet); monitor approves or rejects.
   - Approved → points deducted, reward marked redeemed.
   - Rejected → request cancelled, points released.

### 6. Wishlist

- User can mark any reward as "wishlist" when they don't yet have enough points.
- Wishlist shows: reward name, cost, current balance, points needed.
- Progress bar toward each wishlist reward.
- When balance reaches the cost, user gets a notification/badge prompting them to redeem.

### 7. Monitor / Invite System

- User generates an invite link or sends an email invite to a monitor.
- Monitor signs up / logs in via magic link.
- Connection is per-user: one user can have multiple monitors; a monitor can watch multiple users.

**Monitor permissions:**
- View the user's habit list and action log history.
- View point balance and full redemption history.
- Approve or reject pending reward redemption requests.
- Create and edit habits and rewards on behalf of the user (with user's prior consent, granted at invite time).

**Monitor does NOT have permission to:**
- Log actions on behalf of the user.
- Spend or transfer points.
- Remove the user's account or data.

### 8. Notifications (PWA push / in-app)

- Action log approved or rejected by monitor.
- Redemption request approved or rejected.
- Streak milestone reached.
- Wishlist item now affordable.
- Pending action awaiting monitor approval (monitor-side).
- Pending redemption awaiting monitor approval (monitor-side).

## Google Stitch UI Design Prompt

> Use this prompt verbatim (or lightly adapted) when opening a new Google Stitch session to explore the visual design of Motivate Me. Update this section whenever core UX decisions are confirmed so it stays in sync with the product.

---

```
App name: Motivate Me
Platform: Mobile-first PWA (iOS & Android). Design as a native-feeling mobile app at 390 × 844 px (iPhone 14 viewport). All screens should feel installable — no browser chrome, no scrollable web pages. Think Duolingo meets Habitica: bold, colorful, gamified, with satisfying micro-interactions.

--- BRAND DIRECTION ---

Personality: Playful, encouraging, celebratory. Never punishing. Rewards effort and consistency.
Visual style: Vibrant but not chaotic. One strong primary color with high-contrast accent for CTAs. Rounded corners everywhere (16–24 px radius on cards). Generous whitespace. Friendly, rounded sans-serif typeface (e.g. Nunito, Poppins, or similar).
Color palette direction: Start from a warm violet/indigo primary (#6C47FF or similar) with a bright yellow-orange accent (#FFB800) for points and rewards. White card surfaces on a very light lavender background. Success green for completed actions. Use color intentionally — habit streaks glow, point gains animate in gold.
Iconography: Filled, rounded icons. Custom illustrated badge/trophy assets for milestone moments.
Micro-interactions: Confetti burst on streak milestone. Point counter ticks up like an odometer. Checkmark bounces on habit log. Reward card flips on redemption.

--- NAVIGATION ---

Bottom tab bar (5 tabs, icon + label):
  1. Home (house icon) — Dashboard
  2. Habits (lightning bolt) — Habit list
  3. Log (large center FAB button, "+" icon, elevated, accent color) — Log an action
  4. Rewards (gift box) — Reward catalog + wishlist
  5. Me (person icon) — Profile, monitors, settings

--- SCREENS TO DESIGN ---

## Long-Term Roadmap

### Native Mobile App

Migrate from PWA to native mobile using Capacitor (wrapping the existing React app). This unlocks native APIs not available in the browser and enables App Store / Play Store distribution.

| Phase | Milestone | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add Capacitor to project | `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/cli`, iOS + Android targets |
| 2 | Native camera integration | Replace browser file picker with `@capacitor/camera` for photo proof |
| 3 | Push notifications | `@capacitor/push-notifications` + Supabase Edge Function for delivery |
| 4 | Haptic feedback | `@capacitor/haptics` on point earn, streak milestone, reward redeem |
| 5 | App Store / Play Store submission | Icons, screenshots, privacy policy, store listings |
| 6 | Background sync | Sync action logs queued offline when connectivity resumes |

See `docs/mobile-native-publishing-guide.md` for full publishing and account details.

| **Oura Ring** | Oura Cloud API (OAuth 2.0) | iOS, Android, Web | Sleep score, readiness, activity, heart rate, HRV, body temperature | OAuth 2.0; Personal access token or OAuth app |
| **Samsung Health** | Samsung Health SDK | Android (Samsung devices) | Steps, workouts, heart rate, sleep, blood pressure, SpO2 | Samsung Health app permission; limited to Samsung ecosystem |
| **Strava** | Strava API v3 (OAuth 2.0) | iOS, Android, Web | Activities (run, ride, swim), distance, pace, elevation, heart rate zones | OAuth 2.0; rate-limited (100 req/15 min, 1000 req/day) |
| **Peloton** | Unofficial API (no official public API) | Web (scraping/reverse-engineered) | Workouts, output, cadence, heart rate, class history | Username/password; fragile, may break |
| **Withings** | Withings API (OAuth 2.0) | iOS, Android, Web | Weight, body composition, blood pressure, sleep, activity | OAuth 2.0; requires Withings developer account |
| **MyFitnessPal** | No public API (discontinued 2022) | N/A | N/A — must use photo proof + LLM verification instead | N/A |

```

**On-device sources** (Apple Health, Google Health Connect): Data is read directly on the device using native plugins. No server-side API needed. The app requests permission, reads relevant metrics, and syncs summaries to Supabase.

**Cloud API sources** (Fitbit, Garmin, Strava, etc.): OAuth tokens are stored in Supabase. A scheduled Edge Function polls each API for new data, normalizes it, and writes to the `health_data` table.

#### Implementation Steps Per Platform

| Step | Apple HealthKit | Google Health Connect | Fitbit / Garmin / Strava (Cloud APIs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Plugin/SDK** | `@nickreynolds/capacitor-healthkit` or `capacitor-health-connect` (iOS portion) | `capacitor-health-connect` | Supabase Edge Function + fetch |
| **2. Permissions** | Add `HealthKit` capability in Xcode; request per-data-type read access | Add Health Connect permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`; request at runtime | OAuth consent screen; user authorizes data scopes |
| **3. Data read** | Query `HKSampleQuery` for steps, workouts, sleep in date range | Query `readRecords()` for steps, exercise sessions, sleep | `GET /user/-/activities/date/{date}.json` (Fitbit) or equivalent |
| **4. Normalize** | Map HealthKit types → internal schema (activity type, duration, calories, timestamp) | Map Health Connect records → same internal schema | Map API response JSON → same internal schema |
| **5. Sync to DB** | Batch insert into `health_data` table via Supabase client | Same as HealthKit | Edge Function writes to `health_data` table |
| **6. Auto-verify habits** | Match incoming data against habit rules (e.g., "Run 30+ min" → check workouts ≥ 30 min) | Same matching logic | Same matching logic |
| **7. Award points** | If rule matched and not already logged → create `action_log` + credit `point_ledger` | Same | Same |
| **8. Privacy** | Show Apple Health usage description in `Info.plist`; data stays on device until user syncs | Show Health Connect rationale dialog | Privacy policy must disclose API data usage; tokens encrypted at rest |

#### Proposed Data Model Addition

```sql
-- New table for normalized health/fitness data
CREATE TABLE health_data (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,

#### Privacy & Compliance Considerations

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Apple HealthKit guidelines** | Must provide clear usage description; cannot store raw HealthKit data on external servers without consent; cannot use health data for advertising |
| **Google Health Connect policy** | Must declare Health Connect permissions in Play Store listing; limited use policy applies |
| **HIPAA** | Not applicable unless app makes medical claims — Motivate Me is wellness/fitness only |
| **GDPR** | Health data is "special category" under GDPR — requires explicit consent, purpose limitation, right to deletion |
| **Data minimization** | Only sync data types relevant to user's configured habits; never bulk-export all health data |
| **Token security** | Store OAuth refresh tokens encrypted in Supabase; never expose in client-side code |

### AI-Powered Photo Proof Verification

Use LLM vision models to automatically analyze photo proof submitted with habit logs. This replaces or supplements manual monitor review for verifying actions like eating healthy meals, completing workouts, cleaning, studying, etc.

#### How It Works

```

#### Supported Verification Scenarios

| Habit Category | What the LLM Detects | Example Prompt to Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Nutrition / Meals** | Food type, portion size, protein presence, vegetables, meal balance | "Does this photo show a meal with a visible protein source (meat, fish, eggs, tofu, beans)? Estimate the portion." |
| **Workout / Exercise** | Gym setting, exercise equipment, active pose, outdoor run, yoga mat | "Does this photo show a person actively exercising or in a gym/workout environment?" |
| **Cleaning / Tidying** | Clean room, organized space, before/after comparison | "Does this photo show a clean, organized living space?" |
| **Reading / Studying** | Open book, notebook, study materials, desk setup | "Does this photo show active reading or studying with visible books or study materials?" |
| **Hydration** | Water bottle, glass of water, water tracker | "Does this photo show a water bottle or glass of water being consumed?" |
| **Meditation / Mindfulness** | Meditation pose, calm setting, meditation app on screen | "Does this photo show a meditation or mindfulness practice setting?" |
| **Outdoor / Nature** | Outdoor scenery, park, trail, natural sunlight | "Does this photo show an outdoor nature setting suggesting a walk or hike?" |
| **Medication / Supplements** | Pills, vitamin bottles, supplement containers | "Does this photo show medication or supplements being taken?" |

#### LLM Provider Options

| Provider | Model | Vision Support | Cost (per 1K images) | Latency | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Yes — native multimodal | ~$3–5 (depending on image size) | 1–3s | High accuracy, nuanced understanding, safety-conscious |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini | Yes — native multimodal | ~$2–5 (4o), ~$0.50 (4o-mini) | 1–2s | Fast, cost-effective with 4o-mini for simple checks |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Yes — native multimodal | ~$0.10–0.40 | <1s | Cheapest option, good for high volume |
| **Self-hosted** | LLaVA / Llama 3.2 Vision | Yes (open-source) | Infra cost only | Varies | Full data control, no API dependency |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Claude Sonnet 4.6** for accuracy and safety, with **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as a fallback for cost-sensitive high-volume checks. Use a tiered approach: Flash for simple yes/no checks, Sonnet for ambiguous cases requiring nuance.

#### Implementation Details

**Edge Function pseudocode:**

```typescript
// supabase/functions/verify-photo/index.ts
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk'

const client = new Anthropic()

export async function verifyPhoto(
  imageUrl: string,
  habitName: string,
  habitDescription: string,
  verificationPrompt: string
): Promise<{ approved: boolean; confidence: number; reason: string }> {

  const response = await client.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6-20250514',
    max_tokens: 256,
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'image', source: { type: 'url', url: imageUrl } },
        { type: 'text', text: `You are verifying photo proof for a habit tracking app.

Habit: "${habitName}"
Description: "${habitDescription}"
Verification question: "${verificationPrompt}"

Analyze this photo and respond with JSON:
{
  "approved": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reason": "brief explanation"
}

Be strict but fair. If the photo is ambiguous, set confidence below 0.7.` }
      ]
    }]
  })

  return JSON.parse(response.content[0].text)
}
```

**Approval logic:**

| Confidence Score | Action |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.85 | Auto-approve — points awarded immediately |
| 0.50 – 0.84 | Flag for monitor review — show AI assessment alongside photo |
| < 0.50 | Auto-reject — notify user with reason, allow resubmission |

**Anti-fraud measures:**

| Measure | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **EXIF metadata check** | Verify photo timestamp is within 1 hour of submission time |
| **Reverse image search** | Hash the image and check against previously submitted photos by the same user |
| **Location plausibility** | Optional — check EXIF GPS against expected location (e.g., gym address) |
| **Duplicate detection** | Perceptual hash (pHash) to detect reuse of same/similar photos |
| **Rate limiting** | Max 1 photo verification per habit per hour to prevent gaming |

#### Proposed Data Model Addition

```sql
-- Photo verification results
CREATE TABLE photo_verifications (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  action_log_id uuid REFERENCES action_logs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  llm_provider text NOT NULL,        -- 'anthropic', 'openai', 'google'
  llm_model text NOT NULL,           -- 'claude-sonnet-4-6', 'gpt-4o-mini', etc.
  approved boolean NOT NULL,
  confidence numeric NOT NULL,       -- 0.0 to 1.0
  reason text,                       -- LLM explanation
  prompt_used text,                  -- the verification prompt sent
  response_raw jsonb,                -- full LLM response for audit
  cost_cents integer,                -- API cost in cents for tracking spend
  latency_ms integer,                -- response time
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Per-habit verification configuration
ALTER TABLE habits ADD COLUMN ai_verification_enabled boolean DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE habits ADD COLUMN ai_verification_prompt text;
ALTER TABLE habits ADD COLUMN ai_confidence_threshold numeric DEFAULT 0.85;
```

#### Cost Estimation

| Usage Level | Photos/Month | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Hybrid (Flash + Sonnet fallback) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Light (1 user, 2 habits) | ~60 | ~$0.30 | ~$0.02 | ~$0.05 |
| Moderate (10 users, 3 habits) | ~900 | ~$4.50 | ~$0.30 | ~$0.75 |
| Heavy (100 users, 5 habits) | ~15,000 | ~$75 | ~$5 | ~$12 |
| Scale (1,000 users) | ~150,000 | ~$750 | ~$50 | ~$120 |

## Open Questions

- Should bonus point values for streak milestones be system-defined or user-configurable per habit?
- Should monitors receive email notifications for pending approvals, or only in-app?
- Is there a maximum number of monitors per user?
- For AI photo verification, should users be able to customize the verification prompt per habit, or should the system infer it from the habit name/description?
- For health data integration, should auto-verified habit completions bypass monitor approval, or should monitors still be able to override?
- What is the acceptable false-positive rate for AI photo verification before it undermines trust in the point system?
